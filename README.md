ETANET: A joint framework of extracting event triggers and arguments for undefined event schema.

Event trigger and argument extraction techniques based on unscheduled event schema refer to the methodologies that automatically identify and extract event triggers and arguments from texts without the aid of established event patterns. This approach is particularly relevant for emerging or rapidly evolving fields that lack extensive annotated data and established event schema, necessitating a viable framework for the automatic identification and extraction of event triggers and arguments to facilitate the subsequent construction of event knowledge bases. 

The framework is described in the picture.

However, the extraction of event triggers and arguments without predefined event schema faces several challenges. Initially, the primary concern is how to leverage abundant unannotated data to enable the model to learn event knowledge in domains where annotated data are sparse. Furthermore, enhancing the model's transferability and generalizability to extract event triggers and arguments across various domains poses a significant challenge. Additionally, in the absence of information on event schema, the complexity of extracting event triggers and arguments for complex events, such as overlapping and nested events, becomes pronounced. To address these issues associated with event trigger and argument extraction without predefined event schema.


Considering the inability of current research to handle the extraction of overlapping and nested event triggers and arguments under undefined event schema, this work first use a new data annotation schema to facilitate the annotation of triggers and arguments for overlapping and nested events in undefined event schema. Building on this, a joint extraction framework for event triggers and arguments based on an improved pretrained model is designed. The framework leverages the event trigger and argument extraction pretrained model to capture the features of events. To further address the more complex issues of overlapping and nested extractions, the framework incorporates an information fusion layer. This layer employs an attention mechanism and P-Tuning technique to acquire abstract event type features and uses a gated conditional normalization layer for the conditional fusion of event type features and semantic features. Eventually, to predict the relationships between triggers and arguments, an added span-relation joint prediction layer views the task as a span and relation judgment task between word pairs, on one hand, employing convolutional neural networks to capture the local and global information between word pairs, enriching the representation of word pair characteristics and assessing probabilities; on the other hand, utilizing a span and relation extractor to capture the head and tail feature information of arguments and triggers, as well as their dependency relations, followed by employing a deep biaffine network for probability prediction of word pairs. Finally, by combining the two probability prediction results, the model significantly improves the efficacy of recognizing and extracting triggers and arguments.
