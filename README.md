ETANET: A joint framework of extracting event triggers and arguments for undefined event schema

Event trigger and argument extraction techniques based on unscheduled event schema refer to the methodologies that automatically identify and extract event triggers and arguments from texts without the aid of established event patterns. This approach is particularly relevant for emerging or rapidly evolving fields that lack extensive annotated data and established event schema, necessitating a viable framework for the automatic identification and extraction of event triggers and arguments to facilitate the subsequent construction of event knowledge bases. However, the extraction of event triggers and arguments without predefined event schema faces several challenges. Initially, the primary concern is how to leverage abundant unannotated data to enable the model to learn event knowledge in domains where annotated data are sparse. Furthermore, enhancing the model's transferability and generalizability to extract event triggers and arguments across various domains poses a significant challenge. Additionally, in the absence of information on event schema, the complexity of extracting event triggers and arguments for complex events, such as overlapping and nested events, becomes pronounced. To address these issues associated with event trigger and argument extraction without predefined event schema.
