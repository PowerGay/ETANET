# ETANET
ETANET: A joint framework of extracting event triggers and arguments for undefined event schema.

Event trigger and argument extraction techniques based on unscheduled event schema refer to the methodologies that automatically identify and extract event triggers and arguments from texts without the aid of established event patterns. This approach is particularly relevant for emerging or rapidly evolving fields that lack extensive annotated data and established event schema, necessitating a viable framework for the automatic identification and extraction of event triggers and arguments to facilitate the subsequent construction of event knowledge bases. The framework is described in the picture.
